the critical phase of the day isn’t here yet, so looking forward to the ending
of the day, so willingly indulging myself in acts of blissful procrastination,
when I wouldn’t even be working on anything productive after suffering through
another repetition of self-torture? It is the exact same routine. If anything,
it is worsening exponentially. But isn’t this the best feeling? Knowingly doing
nothing about an urgent upcoming event in the little time that is left,

to ‘turn back time’ after failing a boss or regretting a decision. The sense of
this act is taking root in my subconscious, and I sometimes go about reality
wanting to ‘load a save file’ to do things differently or to put to better use
any lost time or to see more clearly the events that has transpired, to more
deeply understand a memory. Sometimes I find myself confused that it didn’t

sometimes, I see myself as a genius that is destined to greatly impact the

is all-accommodating, my mind is superior. I can say it like I have already
said it a million times before: I am a genius. I have so many plans. I can come
up with so many possibilities. I have so much potential. What am I doing? How
am I proving it? Once I recall that I still have no answers to these questions,
I sink back into reality. I guess everyone feels that way from time to time. So
no worries, right? I am not entirely delusional.]</span></p>

would usually be at least half a dozen tiny mishaps during my rituals, and I
usually have no choice but to force myself to neglect it or to rationalise it.
Laziness, hunger, sleepiness and exhaustion in general can play a very helpful
role in persuading my mind. I would convince myself to assume the best, or tell
myself that maybe it did not happen at all, that I am merely seeing things.
Recently, I have even developed the ability to slightly alter my memories, to
reinterpret a situation, to forget a specific detail of anything. It is pretty
interesting, though at the same time terrifying. It may sound like it is a
wonderful skill, or maybe it simply shows how my mind is getting really
distorted and the side effects have just begun. How long until everything bad
peaks?]</span></p>

for one am eager for a voice to emerge from the back of my mind, for another
entity to live in my head. People usually see those voices as obstructions and
hindrances and disturbances, yet I truly believe it would be a very pleasant
thing to have an eternal companion to share all my experiences with. This voice
could remind me of the wonderful things I once learned, praise me whenever I make
an accomplishment, criticise me whenever I act like a prick, discuss theories
and opinions and concepts with me, and so much more. It would literally be like
having myself as a friend. And oh, how I would like to one day be able to talk with
a separate instance of myself. The things we could accomplish number to
infinity! How can anyone in this mentally-lonely misunderstanding-filled
reality not agree?]</span></p>

Rationality. Impulse. Protectivity. Consideration. Wisdom. Integrity.
Reflectivity. Empathy. Anxiety. I like to believe that I can fragment my
personality to make the smaller parts more controllable, that whenever I need
to portray a certain type of character for a certain situation or scenario, I
can summon a specific persona to my aid. Like some kind of game. I wonder if
the time has come for me to truly devote myself to this belief, to shatter
myself into dozen pieces, so that my life could be more ordered and manageable.
The persona that embodies my anxiety is perhaps the most troublesome one for me
right now, yet he is also the source of my hyperactive-creativity and
imagination. Sounds like a concept out of those psychological movies, yes, but
look: if my imagination could create problems, it could solve them. I wonder…]</span></p>

am a very curious person. I wish to witness how everyone’s lives would be if I
become non-existent, all memory of me gone and erased from reality. I just want
to see how much better it would be. Would there be any negative difference? Am
I crucial to the course of events, to causality? Or would the world of my
people be much better off without me? If only there is a way to realistically
simulate such a wonder. I am tired of not knowing whether or not I might be
useful to anyone. I am tired of being a burden. I am tired. I want to sate this
curiosity.]</span></p>

difficult days, or as difficult as they could be for privileged scum like me, I
would accidentally perceive myself as the unluckiest person in the world. Not
even close. It is not a competition, of course, and acknowledging the suffering
one is going through, no matter how small, is the path to being cured. But it
is hard not to think that I am not utilising the opportunities I am so
blissfully granted. It is easy, however, to ignore it and put off pondering on
it to continue making myself ‘unlucky’ and endlessly complain. Stagnancy is
addictive.]</span></p>

ideologies are different from those around me. They do not understand. They do
not dare. My ambitions; my dreams; my desires; my purpose; my directive; my
duty; my role. Yes, I wholeheartedly believe I have a part to play in the story
of this world. I am not one to simply be content in surviving on the side-lines,
in the masses, among the mundane. I seek attention; I seek acknowledgement; I
seek judgment. These are changing times, and the world has never been as
chaotic and connected as it is right now. I need to do what I have always
thought I must do. I have the mind for it, and there is nothing else for me. If
I succeed, I would receive grand applause; if I must fail, I would do so
spectacularly and gloriously. Either way, I will make an example of myself, to
create a definition worthy of comparison, to chase the conclusion of my role.
Like a revolutionary firework: to put on a fantastic display or to fizzle out
high in the night sky. There is no other alternative.]</span></p>

daydream. This habit could result in otherwise-avoidable mishaps during my
rituals and I would be in great distress afterwards. But I cannot help myself.
These castles in my head, so vividly coloured and so vaguely grey, and in them
I build the backstories for the characters in my world; I adopt their personalities
to better synchronise with their decisions; I think up various fantastical
elements that could enhance the central plot; and finally, I see if I could
remember how I have defined these characters despite not noting them down the
way most professionals do. They exist in my mind. My mind…]</span></p>

want to make background soundtracks for the venues in my daily life so I could
more properly imagine life as a game. And wouldn’t it be a grand idea? It is
gaming that introduced such a concept, with how the music changes depending on
the scenery and the location, so I find it bizarre how no one thought to do
such a thing in this reality. That is fine, I guess. It just means this is an
original proposal. First, of course, would be where I wake up every morning and
where I sleep every night. The most peaceful place in the world, and the most
exhausting; the core checkpoint; the sacred bonfire: Home.]</span></p>

works. My performances. Even though I showed them to the people close to me, I
do not remember frequently asking them for their thoughts and feedback. It is
so disrespectful of me. They spent their time indulging me, the least I could
do was ask them how they felt. Why, then? Am I afraid? Am I ashamed? Do I not
want their opinions? Do I want to make myself a dramatic mystery? Do I prefer
to make it an unspoken understanding? I thank them, and then I leave. What in
the world do they think of me? Not wanting to know, I run away from asking.
Again and again, stuck in a strange limbo, like how I am in so many other
things, drowning in stagnancy.]</span></p>

others remember my embarrassing moments the way I do? Pretentious declarations,
half-assed performances, moody dialogues. At any reminder of those horrifying
memories, I shudder and curse. But is everyone not the same? Why does it feel
that there will be much more of such regrettable decisions in the near future?
However, I actually feel quite excited for them, for any kind of shame is
better than being as idle as I currently am, for at least I would be trying my
hand at something, for at the very least I am playing at a role. To fail
extraordinarily; isn’t that the directive I gave myself? So…why not?]</span></p>

is the ironic art of procrastination, is it not? The silver-blue needle can
only be found when I am not looking for it; the silver-blue needle that carries
the threads of dreams and desires. And so when I am actually properly convenient,
I procrastinate, to see if it happens again. And each time, guess what happens?
Stagnancy is a wild drug.]</span></p>

any earlier? Time does not cooperate with my endeavours at all. Resistance is
futile, so why try at all? Why don’t I spend half my day for each ritual? Why
don’t I go at it at my own pace? Why should I try to improve? It does not matter,
and to be honest, I do not mind that all that much. Really, I would rather let
myself be at ease, gradually wasting away my lifeforce, eventually decaying and
rotting and disappearing. It does not matter. What?]</span></p>

to ask when I have achieved excellency, when everything is calmer and more
comfortable. If the me who is currently very un-excellent ask now, everyone
will be put in an awkward spot. Isn’t it more convenient if it’s a conversation
about ‘those worse days?’. But knowing immediately – knowing everyone’s
perspective of me right away – will definitely be of aid to my efforts in
achieving that excellency. Yet I’m not worthy to know, not yet. Such a wild
paradox. And so I run and run and run, deeper into time, getting lost being the
only thing I achieve immediately.]</span></p>

money to buy a properly useful and memorable gift on our own. So we gather some
people and each of us chip in for the birthday boy or girl. I am included in
many of these deals, but there is one significant difference. Most of them make
their own money, so it feels as if they are chipping in with their heart and
soul. I don’t; I see it as me owing another small sum to my parents. Am I
worthy of the right to chip in like this? It’s an unimportant question, but
it’s strange, really, isn’t it? It’s like it’s not even genuine. Might they
stop asking me when they find out? Everyone is growing up, after all. What a

read these messages in the right mood so as to not disrespect the sender. No

am, essentially, too lazy to muster the right mood for these occasions. Soon,
if I let myself continue like this, I wouldn’t have these occasions any longer,
because people would soon be too fed up with me and I would not blame them. I’m
a prick. I deserve it. I’m not just admitting this so people would think I

share with me their opinions and interests and ideas while I listen intently.
Maybe I am simply here to provide a trivial enhancement to their personalities,
to ensure that everyone I love succeed in their respective storylines. If that
is true, wouldn’t it be such an honour? Such arrogance, such audacity; to think
that I'm even worth anything conveys the truth: my stubbornness in endlessly
denying my lack of worth.]</span></p>

motivation to do anything at all is a result of an ideal arrangement of
hormones and neurons, and so are other aspects of life such as perseverance,
intelligence, composure, impulse, charm, confidence, open-mindedness,
discipline, whatever. Every trait, every characteristic. It’s like those
lottery games that depend on Random Number Generators. Every atom or particle in
reality has its own respective momentum. Doesn’t it mean that everything is
already predetermined? Life is based wholly on luck, isn’t it? ‘The Plan’? ‘Fate’?
‘Destiny’? ‘The Heavens’? So many names for the same thing, this game of life.
