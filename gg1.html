lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Golden
Grapes</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>A
boy and his spyglass</span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Once
upon a time, a boy was tasked to acquire golden grapes from distant lands. Like
other children, this is a coming-of-age adventure meant to hone his inner-self
and, most importantly, to assess if he has what it takes to seize his future.
Unlike other younglings, however, they who have mastered the golden arts that allow
them to multiply each grape they pluck, he did not put in sufficient effort in
exploring that craft. Moreover, it is said that there are a scarce few of the
highly gifted and diligent who can by themselves weave grapevines of gold,
securing a reliable supply of grapes for their families after bringing back their
first stash of pluckings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Despite
his clear disadvantages which are undeniably self-brought, the boy set out
anyway to pursue the ending of his task. The journey was difficult but not too
overwhelming, for a silver spoon could still fend off most hazards. Yet midway,
he turned back home with a single black grape and a crumbled resolve, realizing
that his wants and the task given to him do not align. He craves the golden basket
that no one has ever found, yet accepts the inescapable fact that he is not
even worthy to yearn for half a golden grape, the black grape a constant
reminder of his failings, those of the past and even more in the coming future.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But
there is one failure that stands as an overbearing symbol: his inability to
adjust himself to general expectations. And his neighbours look to his family
and whisper of his misfortune and his misdoings and his lack of decision, for
what other path is there but the search for golden grapes? And his peers revise
on the letters they exchanged, and he learns of their progress and he envies
their great strength, then they ask him of his thoughts on his own journey and
he lies that he has glimpsed a golden sliver of light that very day, and
finally he retreats, because heavens forbid them knowing of his unfounded
confidence in his gut, for what other path is there but the search for golden
grapes? He himself does not know, yet he can imagine wondrous golden apples and
golden peaches cradled in the lush embrace of the golden basket; such pictures
tug at his mind like nothing else.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And
with the molten remains of the silver spoon, the sap of the black grape and the
smoulders of his crumbled resolve, he fashions himself a Spyglass, to look for
something in the nothingness everyone else is ignoring, for the only way out of
his predicament is an escape, and the only escape this act of risk. Everything
he has had – every blessing he could call up – transformed into this single
tool for a single purpose which might almost amount to nothing; if that is not
a gamble, nothing could be one. He has decided that he could only give his all to
this goal that concerns the golden basket; anything else and his will would not
be at its best.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But
where will that will lead him? So pray enlighten him, High Heavens above, for
where else can he look to for what he wants? Is he to settle beneath his
ever-piling mistakes and regrets, forever shackled by the reminders that he
blundered in comparing himself to others? Their golden grapes are in hand, and
they will soon return, and yet the boy idles with his Spyglass, gazing far into
the horizon to see if he could find some way, any way at all, to chart a hidden
path. He promises that they will soon see, that the whispers will soon be
muffled praises. But he knows, without any doubt, he knows. Whenever he looks
into the mirror, he recalls this that he knows: that he is, by being
delusional, convincing himself that he is still searching. Yet delusional he
accepts he is, yet continue striving for this delusion he definitely will,
because pray enlighten him, what else can he do? Is he to- Ha! Well, is he not
doing exactly that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>‘The
world is pack-filled with those that have found their golden grapes, but what
do the grapes avail them? Is it not naught but another insistent factor for the
next generation of younglings to set out on their journeys in search of golden
grapes, to be asked to invest their lives in this mundane pursuit? How new can
their journeys be? No, no, that’s not it, that might have gone off on a
tangent, but…Everyone has had the same goal: the golden grapes, yet out there
is a golden basket, a bountiful horde of richness. Those who acquired a few
will never amount to those who plucked dozens. Why are there not others who
could deign to see it this way? Why do they submit to this structured natural
order when it is not structured at all? There is a golden basket! Do they not see
it?’</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
boy mumbles to himself, but does he himself see it? He resumes his searching,
peering out with his spyglass, and the wind blows and the world watches.</span></p>
