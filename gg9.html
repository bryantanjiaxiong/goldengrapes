Grapes</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Take
This From An Old Man</span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Where
are you going? Is this how you wish to spend the rest of your life? You can
only be young for so long, you know? If you don’t do something about this soon,
you’d regret it.” One of the old men preaches.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b><i><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
would regret everything either way. I just need something that would bring less
regrets, something that I can properly relate with. It’s an important choice to
make; I need more time.</span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“But
you’re not doing anything. You’re completely idle.” Another speaks up. “This should
be your period of building up a foundation. You have to decide on a path and see
where it takes you. It’d be more difficult to catch up to society the longer
you remain here.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b><i><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Tell
me something I don’t know. This is but a risk I have to take. There is no
turning back, after all. This is a path as well.</span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Why
is no one else taking this risk you’re speaking of? What makes you different?”
It is an elderly woman this time. “The decision you’re trying to make is the
decision everyone has already made. Why can’t you do the same? No, let me
rephrase that: Why do you think you cannot do the same?” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b><i><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
don’t have the diligence and the discipline to persevere through just any
decision. It has to be a decision that encompasses all of me. If I make a
slightly wrong choice, I wouldn’t be able to give it my all – I know I wouldn’t
– and then I would be lagging behind. I wouldn’t be able to compete with their
personalities. </span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Everyone
is simply doing their best. You can think like you are thinking now only
because you have the privilege of stalling. You still have resources
maintaining your current lifestyle. But you should really learn to only depend
on yourself.” The old woman is holding nothing back. “You’re already past the
age. It’s time for you to make use of your privilege to actually decide. Not
everyone has this opportunity to choose for themselves, don’t you understand?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b><i><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Exactly.
I am lucky to have this privilege. So since I do, I can complain that: if I
cannot be better than my competition, why try at this path at all? I would
rather regret pressing my time to its limit than regret succumbing to the
pressure of surviving. I have the privilege of thinking that that is not all
that I want.</span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Do
you see your problem? You’re acting very spoilt.” The old man who spoke first
returns. “Every person must grow up to be mature and realistic. You have people
you should be supporting, but now they’re supporting you instead. What happens
when your role is suddenly very necessary? Is this the risk you’re also willing
to take then?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b><i><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
may sound like I am desperate to be right. I am, yes, I’m extremely stubborn.
But if I choose a path in where I cannot properly flourish, I couldn’t give
back to everyone who is supporting me now. I would not have the time to meet
this ambition, this expectation, because I would be spending most of my time
struggling to appeal and to simply be acceptable. Yes, it is an unreasonable
and unrealistic expectation, but I don’t want to compromise and accept any
less. I don’t want to accept my placement in the pyramid of society that tells
me I must compromise. You don’t need to tell me to be afraid. It’s not exactly
easy to be sane when I’m aware of the privileges I’m willing to risk.</span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“You
want to live and not merely survive, is that it? And I thought today’s youth
are not ones to be cheesy.” The other old man declares after a thoughtful
silence. “But you’re certainly immature, though at least you’ve admitted it. It’s
clear that you haven’t yet faced a truly terrible pain that might teach you to
be thankful for what you already have, to be content with just any reasonably good
path at all.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b><i><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Before
something like that could happen to me, I have the privilege of thinking like I
do, do I not?</span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
woman sighs deeply. “Eventually, you’re going to have to make a decision, and
you must bring yourself to live with it. Perhaps that is why you’re so hesitant
to make your choice. But one day, you’ll be forced to move on, whether you like
it or not. And before that day comes, however much you insist that you would
remain in your lane of thinking, it’s simply a fact that working on a
conventional path right now is ever more advisable.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b><i><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Right.
I will be regretting then. There is no other alternative; not for me. I’m
sorry. It may look like your words are falling on deaf ears – and maybe they
are – but though my body is idle, my mind isn’t exactly so. Maybe I would
finally become practical and mature and realistic tomorrow; that might be much
easier than being tormented by the reminder of my irresponsibility. But maybe
not. I’m used to the latter.</span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>A
fourth person emerge out of the shadows, his presence only now acknowledged. “You
certainly have the conviction to remain in pursuit of your so-called ‘one true
conviction’. Is there anything else you’d like to share?” He inquires with a
tone of finality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b><i><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
refuse to walk down a path to where I can’t stand out, and every conventional
path is just like that. I have this persistence to remain in confusion while in
search of my definition, I have the resources to maintain my persistence until
my search is complete, and I have my character that I have accepted. I think
it’s a rare combination in this reality of immediate competition, and I don’t
wish to squander this last positivity I am holding onto. I think I should treat
myself as an experiment; and if the experiment should fail, I would make sure
to go off in some spectacular way. But until then…</span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“A
clear mind yet uncleared. Nothing makes much sense nowadays anyway. Until then;
until it is time.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b><i><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>For
glory and shame; to clarity, my every morrow.</span></i></b></p>
