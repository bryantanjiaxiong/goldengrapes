style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Come
this way, please, now look: here we see a young adult human male lazily
awaiting his death. Lying on his bed with a laptop on his chest, he is
listening to a soundtrack that he has recently took a liking to. Which is saying
a lot, to be honest. Well, you’ll see. He has just finished his breakfast – a
hearty meal that his mother had to bring in for him – and is now idly scrolling
through some comics. He would probably spend the next few hours doing just
exactly that before setting off on his shower ritual. Oh, that you might want
to see too, but later. After persevering through that long tedious ritual, he
would waste the night away procrastinating the necessity to check his to-do list
while enjoying the fresh homemade bread his mother lovingly prepared before
finally going to bed. Now, you would say, that is quite the life, isn’t it? Privilege
at its finest. The privilege of stagnancy; the privilege of freedom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ah,
finally, the beast has awoken. It is a relief for him that he doesn’t need to
attend to a ritual as long as yesterday’s, though there is still one, and it
still requires a substantial portion of his waking hours. He is already
frustrated that he lost the morning by waking up at noon, yet he immediately
turns to his comics and movies the moment his sleepiness is cleared. His father
enters his room to ask him if he’s feeling fine, but wanting to run away from
answering, he dons an ugly expression on his ugly face. A few hours go by
and…ah…he is asleep once more. Then it is time for the ritual before a lavish dinner
is served to him at night. He proceeds to jump back and forth between several
comic titles before resigning for the day, which in comparison to anyone else’s
was an extremely unproductive one. Despite that, without paying more than two
thoughts to that notion, he shuts his eyes again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Someone’s
calling him for a video chat; a close friend wants an update on his current
life. Now watch him try to respond. Will he lie like he always does? Will he run
off with a half-truth? Or will he-There he goes: a skilful navigation to a
close topic before swerving off completely! So typical. If he is lucky, his
friend would not remember that the question was evaded until at least a week
later. Though he dislikes whenever their attention is on him, he enjoys listening
to his friend’s progress in the journey to actual adulthood, actual
independence, actual self-sustenance, actual pride, actual glory, actual
definition. But there is a feeling of envy and inferiority, of course, and he
hides a sullen smile behind his palm. Isn’t he proud of his friend? Isn’t he
relieved that he is still in their hearts? If only he isn’t like this, then
maybe he could express it, right? Isn’t he aware of how deplorable his
situation is? Does he know of the many questions yet unasked? Not the answers,
no, that’s asking too much; does he know of the thousands of other questions
that he at least knows exist? Like, you know: is he going to spend the rest of his
life listing all those questions down?</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
ritual today was long one, and he looks frustrated and tired. Night has fallen
deep, but he has decided to put off sleeping. He did not spend so much time
placating the rumbling thoughts in his head just to finish up and sleep, after
all. He has plans, he knows, plans he promised himself he would act on back
when he was still suffering through his ritual. But, exhausted, he decides to
watch the beta gameplay of an upcoming game he is looking forward to. It is in
a franchise of dark lore and in-depth world-building and tragic storylines, and
he perceives the video as an educational material for him in his so-called
ambitions. Perhaps, he thinks, his mind would be able to better express the
story he longs to share with the world. How could the viewers be absorbed? How
much uniqueness must be developed in order to stand out? How much can one stray
from convention? Is it really educational? Well, well, why don’t you decide?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Oh,
someone’s calling. His grandparents start the conversation with the most
mundane topics, but he enjoys their presence. He has the duty of checking in
with them regularly and making the most out of their time together, especially
now that he is afflicted with stagnancy. The stories of their childhood
intrigue him, but sometimes he has to force down the urge to run away, the
sensation that he wants to call it a day and end the call. Is he not glad that
he could spend time with them? Is he not the family-loving child he claims to
be? Maybe, just saying, he has not the courage to look them in their eyes when
they shower him with caring questions about his lifestyle. Does he think he
would still have time after he has fixed his mental state, on the tiny
off-chance that he could actually fix it at all? Painful, isn’t it, to be loved
unconditionally while knowing that one is totally bloody useless, if not very
burdening? The world would sooner be rid of this privileged scum, don’t you
agree?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ah,
finally. If there is one passably productive addiction he has, it would be to
videos on history. The shorter ones pull him in the swiftest, though it would
lead to another and then the next, but the longer ones guarantee him quality
depth, something that is difficult to come across. He has been lying on his bed
idly watching these videos for near on two hours now. Compared to his other
activities, it is time well spent. He believes that his mind could absorb the
knowledge of varied cultures, religions, battles, economics, philosophies,
psychologies and politics for future usage in the creation of his world. After
all, what deep lore is there in existence that could rival the world’s? Maybe,
he thinks, he is able to do this only because he is granted the privilege of
stagnancy. No one knows, right? And no one ever will. Whatever has time charted
for him, he wonders; and he hopes, grandeur sleeps within.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
night sinks, magnificent and melancholic, and the beast turns to the window.
The citylights have never been so enchanting. After allowing so many such midnights
to pass unthanked, he is finally appreciating this gift of darkness. He dives into
his thoughts, reflecting on the day and the week and the year he has wasted. No
rewinds, only the road ahead. He fears tomorrow, he realises, he knows why but
he pretends he does not. He takes a sip of hot chocolate, re-enacting the way
his imaginary characters do it, but hoping it is coffee instead. His head nods
heavily, sleep threatening to sweep him up, but he is not done with the night.
He decides: he would go to bed on spotting the fifth car that drives through
that lonely lane of palm trees. Until then, the night is his, and he is the
night’s.</span></p>
