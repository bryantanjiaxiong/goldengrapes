<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:center'><b><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Golden
Grapes</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>A
Shop Between Humanity</span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Welcome
to my humble shop! Look around and see if there’s anything you need for the
day. A new stock of Confidence just arrived, by the way; that one always runs
out in the morning. And have you heard? They seem to be brewing another recipe
for Wisdom, but, personally, I don’t think it’ll go all that well. I would
always recommend a bottle or two of Motivation and Perseverance each, but you
know yourself best, don’t you? So take your time. Here’s a bell; ring it if you
require any assistance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ah,
Inspiration, in search for something different, eh? That was such a quick grab;
‘snatch it as soon as you spot it’, right? Quite fitting. A bottle of Impulse
would work really well with that; quick ideas must come with quick actions,
after all. Just a suggestion. Oh, that aisle over there’s for anything
associated with Charm: Charisma, Wit, Humour, Confidence and such. Yes, go on.
And that one’s for Attitude: stuff like Meekness, Enthusiasm, Arrogance-Woah,
slow down!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
see, that’s quite the concoction for the day: Passion, Curiosity, Naivety
and…Arrogance. Interesting. Is that all? That would be five Traits in total,
right? You should down Inspiration and Passion in one swift go, and as early in
the day as possible. For the others you can take it slowly, got it? Brilliant! Take
care and please come again!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Conviction.
Tact. Persuasiveness. Relatability. I have to say: looks like you have a rough
day ahead of you. But I understand. Speaking is a delicate art, especially to
more than two individuals. There’s always a tempo to keep up with; one mistake
is all it takes. Don’t you think a bottle of Patience will do you some good?
Too much excitement can lead to overenthusiasm, after all, and you seem awfully
jittery.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ha!
Forgive me for bluntly pointing that out. Oh? You’re not done yet? Ah, the
Charisma section is right there. But I opine that Relatability and
Persuasiveness can work together much better than any kind of Charisma. They
are kind of the same, yes, but mixing and blending Traits can sometimes produce
characteristic miracles. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
Passion section? There are many kinds: Personal, Environmental, Conversational…I
see, you just want the casual drip. Yes, I do sell smaller bottles of Traits. Aha,
enhancing Conviction with a Passion drip? That’s a great idea. I can see that
you’re implementing that blending tactic I just introduced. Very well done. That’s
all, right? Marvellous. A very fine day to you as well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Grace?
You look as if you have just taken three doses of it! Ha! And Consideration
too, hm? Must be quite the social gathering. I’d recommend this brand instead.
Heightened Consideration is better than Quick Consideration, more expensive,
yes, but worth the price. It is more focused on all your senses rather than
just empathy. You can add in a standalone Empathy, if you want to, but that’s
really for a different case. It <b><i>is </i></b>for some fancy party, right,
if you can pardon my imposing? You’ve planned well. What else do you need?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Yes,
that’s the Charm aisle. Humour. Bubbly Humour? Curious choice, but that’s not
for me to say, is it? Am I talking too much? That’s a relief to hear. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>That’s
all, then. Let’s see. All of that and…Eagerness and Initiative. Hm. You shouldn’t
be too worried. The way you are handling these purchases perhaps display that
you don’t need them at all. Business is business; however, I will throw in a
small bottle of Random Positive Decision. Please accept it as a simple gesture
of wishing you luck. It’s also an investment in more future trades, eh?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
difference between these two bottles? They’re both Composure, but this one here
is Surging Composure; it keeps you in control of your mind at a certain point when
you’re about to lose it. A sudden grasp of reality. Hanging Composure is less
intense, and is in a maintainable level throughout the day. Very different,
right? For very different occasions. Hanging Composure is for an event when you
would be exposed to stimulation risks for a lengthy duration.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Charisma
over here has three main effect-brands: Direct, Indirect, and Decisive. Direct
Charisma accentuates your mood during your interactions with others, making you
act and stand out in a dominant manner. It might prompt a whole personality
switch, so be careful. Indirect Charisma is more passive, you’d only react and respond
dominantly. And Decisive Charisma takes into account your entire character, so
you’d be able to proactively choose moments or topics that are fitting for you
to engage in. Not all that distinctly varied compared to Composure, but the
applications are more effective depending on the atmosphere and situation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
know, it can be very dramatic. But that’s what you’re here for, isn’t it? To
find the appropriate flair to add to your everyday mood. Well, take your time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>You’re
buying a dozen times more today than you usually do. Ah yes, that section has
Traits that will be in effect for up to a week. But I must warn you: it’s as
risky as it’s expensive. I won’t ask what you’re planning to do, but as a
Trait-trader I would ask you to please take it easy. Say what? A decade? That
is unheard of.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>No,
um…Are you sure? You’re actually planning to down them all in one go? Peak
Personality? That’s very dangerous; where did you even hear of such a thing? If
you stimulate your mind to go all out for just a short time, you would be
feeling drained for the rest of your life. You would risk losing fragments of
your character, and they would never return. As the shopkeeper, I must object
to such a thing happening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Yes,
I know you’ve been adventurous with combining Traits but…I see. Fine. This is
your last time in long time, then. You’ve made up your mind, so I’d rather be
the one to sell these to you than anyone else who might have faulty Traits. But
you’re very certain, huh? Please think about it again before drinking this, um…Here,
it’s not actually for sale but I have the one-and-only-one around the timeline:
The Decadal Brew. Just take it. Down all the Traits you need before downing
that, and everything would last for around ten years. This is a very crazy
thing to do, but…I trust your judgment. Use it wisely.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>If
you don’t mind me asking one last question before you go: how is it that each
time you come, you’re an almost entirely different person? It’s like you don’t
even need these bottles at all. Well, forget it, food for thought, yes? One
last thing: it’s not as good as a proper Trait, but I can only wish you the
best of luck in your endeavours. Be careful, don’t sway; and if fate is kind we
should meet again.</span></p>
